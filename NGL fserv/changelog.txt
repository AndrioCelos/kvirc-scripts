[Noldor, 07 February 2007]
- Added multiple files enqueues

[Noldor, 06 February 2007]
- First step to script localization: there are problems on .mo compilation on win.. Hope we fix it soon ;)... Anyway, now all string support $tr();
- Working on the "new" gui: applly, cancel and ok button will appear very soon: need to manage some internal tab coding (tab channel and trigger).
  At moment the gui is "invisible" and the new cool logo too :)
- Added options to enable removing user from queue when it parts or quit channel.
- Improved wizard appearence and internal code;
- Fixed some minor bugs
Code Changes:
- New gui coding classes almost completed: now we need 1 line of code to add one control :)
[Losko]
- Implemented Load/Save queues/sends (still a little bit incomplete ;) ) 

Known bugs:
- Errors when fserver does not found a trigger path
- Errors sometimes when add/remove extra dirs (this part of code is still instable)
- Bugs in monitor engine

[Noldor, 22 january 2007]
- fixed checkboxes (from now we must use clicked signal instead of toggle signal)
- rewritten virtual tree code and fast load/save tree info (need to remove old config files)
- completed dirview gui (maybe instable... need testing)
- added simple wildcards filter in fserver shell navigation
WARNING: THIS VERSION IS A WIP AND CAN BE VERY UNSTABLE DUE TO THE INTERNAL NEW RECODING AND IT IS NOT YET FULL TESTED! USE IT AT OWN RISK :)

gui changes:
- added a wizard gui to configure quickly a trigger (thanks to hellvis69 for translation in english)
- fixed some warnings in tab sharedfiles (dirview section)
- fixed blank chars bug in "add channel section"
- fixed layout view problems in tab global options
code changes:
- added experimental fastscandrive routine (need a recent KVIrc svn version but it doesn't necessary due to an internal script version check ;) )
- fixed uninstall issues
- added $NGLfserv::corefunctions::addWidget (wizard class and shared folder tab are based on this new widget constructor: in the future we'll use this instead of NGLfserv::classes::customwidgets::box class)
- removed unused code
- optimized asyincload class 
- fixed some aesthetic coding style
work in progress:
- save queues and sends at kvirc exit (at this moment only the load/save functions are ready... need some synch routine with server connection)
- "busy status" is still incomplete.
knows bugs:
- add/delete extra folders is temporarily deactivated due a few bugs
- some others to discovery :P
