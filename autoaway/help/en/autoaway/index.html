		</p>
		<p>
			The "Now Playing" addon allows you to advertise the media
			you're currently playing on IRC channels and queries.
		</p>
		<p>
			The media players supported are the ones supported by
			the mediaplayer kvirc module: at the moment of writing
			"xmms", "amarok", "juk" and "winamp".
		</p>
		<p>

					<b>How it works</b>
				</font>
			</td></tr></table>
		</p>
		<p>
			You advertise your media by the means of a toolbar button
			(that be visible in your KVIrc just after the installation)
			or by the means of the <b>nowplaying_advertise</b> command.
			This command in fact uses /me which in turn sends a CTCP ACTION
			to the target (chanel or query).
		</p>
		<p>
			The message displays
			the title and the artist of the played media and a set
			of optional informations including bitrate, file size etc.
			The format of the message can be configured by accessing
			proper option in the Script Addon Management dialog or by
			using the <b>nowplaying_configure</b> command.
		</p>
		<p>
			The advertised media can be optionally shared with other
			users that can request the download by sending you a
			simple CTCP command.
		</p>

			</td></tr></table>
		</p>
		<p>
			This script contains ideas and small code snippets
			from the Jan Wagner's playing.kvs.
			Chiara Biscaro has spent some time in searching
			icons for the toolbar buttons.

			Have fun :)<br>
