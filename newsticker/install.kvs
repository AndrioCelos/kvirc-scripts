# script newsticker for KVIrc :)
# Written by Szymon Stefanek (2006)


# register the script: this must be the first instruction executed
# since it will abort with an error when a greater version is already installed
addon.register("newsticker","1.2.0",$tr("Newsticker: The RSS News Reader","newsticker"),$tr("Displays RSS news feeds from various sources","newsticker"),"3.2.0.99.20051230",newsticker_32.png)
{
	# This is our uninstall callback: it will be called by KVIrc when addon.uninstall is invoked
	
	newsticker::core::uninstall
}

addon.setconfigurecallback(newsticker)
{
	newsticker::configure
}


# Ok, addon.register succeeded. We can go on with the installation.

# get the installer helper class (this is pretty standard and included in the distro)
include "utils/installer.kvs"

# Get the path that this script was launched from
%mypath = $file.extractPath($0)
//%mypath = $str.lefttolast($0,/)
# The installer will copy our files and generate automatically
# an uninstallation alias for them
%installer = $new(installer,0,myinstaller)
# copy files in each subdirectory
# the pics
%installer->$copyFiles("%mypath/pics/","*.png",$file.localdir("pics"))
# the translations
#%installer->$copyFiles("%mypath/locale/","*.mo",$file.localdir("locale"))
# the documentation
#%installer->$copyFiles("%mypath/help/en/nowplaying/","*.html",$file.localdir("help/en/nowplaying"))
# parse source files
%installer->$includeFiles("%mypath/src/","*.kvs")
# then generate the uninstall alias
%installer->$generateUninstallAlias("newsticker::core::uninstall")
# finally kill the installer helper
delete %installer

# fetch the complete script
//include "src/main.kvs"


# make sure any previous instance is closed
newsticker::close
# show it up :)
newsticker::show
